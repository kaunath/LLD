## Abstract Factory Design Pattern

- **Intent**: The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

- **Key Components**:
    - **Abstract Factory**: An interface or abstract class that declares a set of creation methods for creating families of related objects.
    - **Concrete Factory**: Subclasses or implementations of the Abstract Factory that create specific product objects.
    - **Abstract Product**: An interface or abstract class that declares the interface for a type of product object.
    - **Concrete Product**: Subclasses of the Abstract Product created by Concrete Factories.
    - **Client**: The code that uses the Abstract Factory to create families of products. It's decoupled from the specific classes of products.

- **Advantages**:
    - Encapsulates object creation and promotes loose coupling between clients and products.
    - Ensures that created objects are compatible and belong to the same family.
    - Supports the open-closed principle, allowing the addition of new product families without modifying existing code.

- **When to Use**:
    - When a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.
    - When a system is configured with multiple families of objects and needs to ensure their compatibility.
    - To provide a consistent interface for creating families of related objects.

- **Implementation Steps**:
    1. Define the abstract Factory interface with a set of creation methods for product families.
    2. Create concrete Factory classes that implement the abstract Factory interface for specific product families.
    3. Define abstract Product interfaces or classes for each type of product in the family.
    4. Create concrete Product classes that implement the abstract Product interfaces or classes.
    5. Clients use the abstract Factory to create entire families of related products.

- **Example**:
    - Abstract Factory: `GUIFactory` with methods like `createButton()` and `createCheckbox()`.
    - Concrete Factories: `WindowsFactory`, `MacOSFactory`, etc.
    - Abstract Products: `Button` and `Checkbox` interfaces.
    - Concrete Products: `WindowsButton`, `MacOSButton`, `WindowsCheckbox`, `MacOSCheckbox`, etc.
    - Clients use the `GUIFactory` to create sets of UI components compatible with the chosen platform.
